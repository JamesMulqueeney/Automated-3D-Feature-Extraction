# Data 
All data stored here is used in the results section of the paper. These data can be analysed/ visualised using the R scripts within the the 'R Scripts' Folder. This is as follows:

1. `Dice_Score_Results.csv`: Dice score results for each of the training sets, used in the code for Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
2. `Training_Set_Means.csv`: Mean Dice Scores, used in the code for Section 3.2 (also generated within).
3. `Volumetric_Comparison_Data.csv`: Volumetric Data used in the Manual vs AI comparison within Section 3.3. 
4. `Internal_Shape_Comparison_Data.csv`: Internal Shape Data, used in the Manual vs AI comparison with Section 3.4.
5. `External_Shape_Comparison_Data.csv`: External Shape Data, used in the Manual vs AI comparison with Section 3.4.

# R Scripts 
All R Scripts used in the visualisation and statistical analyis of data are found here. These are used in each of the results sections: 

1. Section 3.1 - `Section_3.1_Early_stopping_vs_200_epochs.R`
2. Section 3.2 - `Section_3.2_Network_Accuracy.R`
3. Section 3.3 - `Section_3.3_Volumetric_Comparison.R` 
4. Section 3.4 - `Section_3.4_Shape_Comparison.R`

# Python Scripts 
Python Scripts used in the analysis, mainly in the processing and generating data. These are as follows:
