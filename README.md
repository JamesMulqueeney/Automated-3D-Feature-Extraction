# Data 
All data stored here is used in the results section of the paper. These data can be analysed/ visualised using the R scripts within the the 'R Scripts' Folder. This is as follows:

1. `Dice_Score_Results`: Dice score results for each of the training sets, used in the code for Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
2. `Training_Set_Means.csv`: Mean Dice Scores, used in the code for Section 3.2 (also generated within).
3. `Volumetric_Comparison_Data.csv`: Volumetric Data used in the Manual vs AI comparison within Section 3.3. 
4. `Internal_Shape_Comparison_Data`: Internal Shape Data, used in the Manual vs AI comparison with Section 3.4.
5. `External_Shape_Comparison_Data`: External Shape Data, used in the Manual vs AI comparison with Section 3.4.
